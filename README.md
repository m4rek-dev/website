# Setup

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) for this project. If you don't have it, you can install it using the script on their website.

1. Install packages:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Make a `config.json`. You can start by copying or renaming `config.json.example` to `config.json`.

3. Run bun-blog listening on the address and port configured in the config:
    ```bash
    bun start
    ```
    - You can also use [Static Building](#static-building).

4. Write your posts inside the `posts` directory using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) following the examples in that folder. You can also use subdirectories to organize your posts.
    - **TIP:** Use `draft: true` to prevent a post from being parsed.

5. Enjoy your blog! üî•

6. (Optional, as bun-blog parses the posts automatically when starting and then every 5 minutes) To manually parse posts use:
    ```bash
    bun run parsePosts
    ```
    - **TIP**: You can also customize the `post.html` in the `templates/posts`. It also populates the {{ posts.list }} template variable, so you can list your posts inside of any HTML file in the `public` folder (this uses the `templates/posts/card.html` template for each post), After parsing, the list of the post cards will be located inside of the `templates/posts/list.html` file.


7. (Optional) Customize your blog with [Themes](#themes)!
    - **TIP:** You can also modify the `index.html` and other files inside the `public` folder (excluding the `posts` folder and `rss.xml`, as the files are dynamically generated by `parsePosts`. the posts are using the `templates/posts/page.html`) as well as the files inside the `templates` folder (excluding `templates/posts/list.html`, as it is also dynamically generated by `parsePosts` using the `templates/posts/card.html` template for each post). You can also use the **[Templates](#templates-variables-and-pages)**.

**If you only have access to a static environment, you can check out [Static Building](#static-building).**


# Themes

You can make themes by adding css files to `public/assets/css`, using the `:root[theme="your-theme"]` (or `html[theme="your-theme"]`) selectors, where "your-theme" is the name of your theme and importing it inside `public/assets/css/styles.css`. To change your theme, use the defaultTheme option in `config.json`. There will be a client-specific theme selector implemented soon.
