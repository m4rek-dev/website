# bun-blog

A customizable, extendendable and easy-to-use markdown blogging website written in Bun! ðŸ”¥

*Theme support coming soon...*

bun install
```

```bash
bun start

**Nice, now you have a new empty blog.**

You can write your posts using markdown in the posts directory. To make them viewable, you need to parse them, so they are added to the public directory.

To parse posts:

```bash
bun run parsePosts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
